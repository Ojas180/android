OjasOS
===========

Getting started
---------------

you'll need to get
familiar with [Repo](https://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html) and [Version Control with Git](https://source.android.com/source/version-control.html).

To initialize your local repository using the LineageOS trees, use a command like this:
```
repo init -u https://github.com/Ojas180/android -b cm-14.1
```
Then to sync up:
```
repo sync -c
```
